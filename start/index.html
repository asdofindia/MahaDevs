    <h2>Welcome, hacker!</h2>

<p>Becoming a developer is very easy.
Becoming a MahaDev takes some hard work.</p>

<p>If you are committed and curious, we&#39;ll help you reach there.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>In our day to day life at Mozilla we work on and come across a lot of bugs. Fixing them requires:</p>

<ol>
<li>Knowledge</li>
<li>Time</li>
</ol>

<p>And unfortunately, while many people have both of these, most people have only one. What do you do when you have a sock from one pair and another from a different pair? You pair what you have up.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what we will do. We will put people who know how to fix things with people who have time to fix things. If all goes well, in some time, we&#39;ll have two people who know how to fix things and at least one with time to.</p>

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<p>The things you will definitely need are:</p>

<ul>
<li>curiosity,</li>
<li>devoted time,</li>
<li>a computer with access to Internet,</li>
<li>a will to break things, and</li>
<li>a will to learn how to fix them yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can promise us those, we promise you the elixir of programming.</p>

<h2>What we will do together</h2>

<ul>
<li>Find bugs anywhere in Mozilla World.</li>
<li>Figure out how to fix them.</li>
<li>Fix them.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you get</h2>

<ol>
<li>Coding skill</li>
<li>Open Badges</li>
<li>&quot;MahaDev&quot; title</li>
</ol>

<h2>What MahaDevs get</h2>

</ol>
